# 🤖 AI Chatbot using LangChain & OpenAI

This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** built using the **LangChain framework** and **OpenAI's GPT models**. It can respond to user queries in a conversational manner and can be easily integrated into web or desktop applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Conversational AI using OpenAI's GPT API
- Modular and scalable code using LangChain
- Supports context-aware conversations
- Easy integration with tools like Streamlit for UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 / GPT-4)**
- **Streamlit** (for web interface)
- **FAISS** (optional: for RAG or vector store)


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Accepts user messages from UI or terminal.
2. **LangChain Pipeline**: Uses chains and prompts to process queries.
